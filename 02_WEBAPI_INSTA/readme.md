## Web API for instagram

The idea was to make an API where you could sort the photos of a user by how many likes it had.
Working with the Instagram API for this hw early on in the term wasn't maybe a very good idea. Even tough the code doesn't look like much. I acctually spent a lot of time on this homework. But found it very difficult to work with the Instagram access_tokens.
